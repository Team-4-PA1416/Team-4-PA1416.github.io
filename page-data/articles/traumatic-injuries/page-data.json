Many of these injuries occur during falls, collisions or cutting manoeuvres. Traumatic injuries are a concern for all athletes as they sometimes lead to long time loss from sport and pain or disability. It is therefore important with knowledge concerning injury management, rehabilitation and prevention of such injuries.</p><p>As a Para athlete and coach it is also important that you are aware of that the athlete´s specific impairment and equipment may increase the risk for some traumatic injuries. If you are a Para athlete that have sustained a traumatic injury it is recommended that you contact an emergency room, a primary care centre or a sports medicine physician or physiotherapist. It is also important to have knowledge about acute injury management. The primary goal here is to stop the bleeding and put pressure on the injury. Use a bandage and apply almost maximal pressure the first 20-30 minutes following an injury, then apply a looser bandage for 1-3 days. Both as an athlete and coach, it is a good idea to always have a bandage in your bag!</p><p></p>","slug":"traumatic-injuries","title":"Traumatic Injuries"}},"pageContext":{"id":"1166dad6-1e49-5749-950b-309c14cedd19","slug":"traumatic-injuries","__params":{"slug":"traumatic-injuries"}}},
